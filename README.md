# dotfiles
Repository containing my config dotfiles

## Motivation

Well when making a fresh system install it is pain getting all apps and setup you need. This repo should make your life much easier in such cases.

## Usage

This repository contains two scripts

1. [bootstrap.sh](bootstrap.sh) which copies/links all dotfiles to appropriate places
2. [install_apps.sh](install_apps.sh) which installs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and then installs desired apps

If you want to use those scripts just download or clone this repo and run them.
